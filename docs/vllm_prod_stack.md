# vLLM Documentation

## Overview üåç
[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-performance , highly efficient  and scalable inference and serving engine for LLMs. It is designed to optimize inference workloads(memory efficiency and maximize throughput) using features likelike **continuous batching** and **paged attention** to maximize GPU utilization and seamless integration with popular deployment stacks.
This document provides an overview of vLLM and its recent updates based on the [llmcache vLLM production-stack](https://github.com/llmcache/vllm-production-stack) project.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **PagedAttention üöÄ**: Enables efficient memory management to handle large context sizes, reducing redundant computation and maximizing GPU utilization.
- **Continuous Batching üì¶**: Dynamically schedules incoming requests for maximum throughput.
- **Multi-GPU and Distributed Support**: Seamless scaling across multiple GPUs and nodes.
- **Fast Token Generation ‚ö°**: Optimized kernel implementation speeds up inference performance.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Works with Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud-based orchestration tools.
- **Multi-Backend Support üîó**: Works across different cloud providers and Kubernetes environments. 

## Latest Updates (2025-01-21)

The latest release of vLLM includes major enhancements and new capabilities:

### Performance Improvements
- **Enhanced Paged Attention**: Reduces memory fragmentation, leading to better GPU utilization.
- **Optimized Kernel Execution**: Improved CUDA kernels for faster inference times.

### New Features
- **Token Streaming API**: Enables real-time token-by-token generation.
- **Checkpointing & Resumption**: Allows restoring model states without full reloading.
- **Hybrid Engine Support**: Runs models efficiently on both GPUs and CPUs.

### Deployment Enhancements
- **Improved Kubernetes Support**: Native Helm charts for streamlined deployment.
- **Auto-scaling with HPA**: Supports Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for demand-based scaling.
- **Cloud Compatibility**: Optimized for AWS, GCP, Azure, OCI, and Civo Kubernetes environments.

## Deployment Guide

### 1. Installation

Using Helm:
```bash
helm repo add vllm https://vllm-project.github.io/helm-charts/
helm install vllm vllm/vllm --namespace vllm --create-namespace
```

### 2. Running vLLM Server

```bash
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model <MODEL_NAME>
```

### 3. Accessing the API

Once deployed, you can query the model using:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/completions" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"prompt": "Hello, world!", "max_tokens": 50}'
```

## vLLM Production Stack üèóÔ∏è

The latest **vLLM Production Stack** simplifies LLM deployment and serving with:

1. **Model Management üß†**
   - Load and manage multiple models efficiently.
   - Hot-swapping between models with minimal downtime.

2. **High-Throughput Serving üö¶**
   - Scales seamlessly across multiple nodes.
   - Optimized for high concurrent requests.

3. **Observability & Monitoring üìä**
   - Built-in metrics and logging.
   - Integration with Prometheus and Grafana.

 
## Roadmap
- **Fine-tuning Support**: Native fine-tuning capabilities for custom models.
- **Optimized FP8 Execution**: Experimental support for lower-precision computation.
- **Enhanced Observability**: Improved logging and monitoring integrations.
